/*
Types are partitioned into object types (types that describe objects) and function types (types that describe functions).

Basic Types:
  - Char
  - Unsigned Int
  - Signed Int
  - Floats

The basic types are complete object types.
Even if the implementation defines two or more basic types to have the same representation, they are nevertheless different types.

An enumeration comprises a set of named integer constant values. Each distinct
enumeration constitutes a different enumerated type.

The type char, the signed and unsigned integer types, and the enumerated types are
collectively called integer types. The integer and real floating types are collectively called
real types.

Integer and floating types are collectively called arithmetic types. Each arithmetic type
belongs to one type domain: the real type domain comprises the real types, the complex
type domain comprises the complex types.

The void type comprises an empty set of values; it is an incomplete object type that
cannot be completed.

Any number of derived types can be constructed from the object and function types, as
follows:

    â€” An array type describes a contiguously allocated nonempty set of objects with a
        particular member object type, called the element type. The element type shall be
        complete whenever the array type is specified. Array types are characterized by their
        element type and by the number of elements in the array. An array type is said to be
        derived from its element type, and if its element type is T , the array type is sometimes
        called â€˜â€˜array of T â€™â€™. The construction of an array type from an element type is called
        â€˜â€˜array type derivationâ€™â€™.
    â€” A structure type describes a sequentially allocated nonempty set of member objects
        (and, in certain circumstances, an incomplete array), each of which has an optionally
        specified name and possibly distinct type.
    â€” A union type describes an overlapping nonempty set of member objects, each of
        which has an optionally specified name and possibly distinct type.
    â€” A function type describes a function with specified return type. A function type is
        characterized by its return type and the number and types of its parameters. A
        function type is said to be derived from its return type, and if its return type is T , the
        function type is sometimes called â€˜â€˜function returning T â€™â€™. The construction of a
        function type from a return type is called â€˜â€˜function type derivationâ€™â€™.
    â€” A pointer type may be derived from a function type or an object type, called the
        referenced type. A pointer type describes an object whose value provides a reference
        to an entity of the referenced type. A pointer type derived from the referenced type T
        is sometimes called â€˜â€˜pointer to T â€™â€™. The construction of a pointer type from a
        referenced type is called â€˜â€˜pointer type derivationâ€™â€™. A pointer type is a complete
        object type.
    â€” An atomic type describes the type designated by the construct _Atomic ( type-
        name ). (Atomic types are a conditional feature that implementations need not
        support; see 6.10.8.3.)
        These methods of constructing derived types can be applied recursively.
