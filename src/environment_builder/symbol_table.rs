/*
An identifier can denote:
    object; 
    a function; 
    a tag or a member of a structure, union, or enumeration; 
    a typedef name; 
    a label name;
*/

different entities designated by the same identifier either have different scopes, or are in different name spaces.

There are four kinds of scopes: 
    - function 
    - file
    - block
    - function prototype. (A function prototype is a declaration of a function that declares the types of its parameters.)

label name is the only kind of identifier that has function scope.
